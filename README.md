The aim of this project is to do real-time facial emotion detection using CNN with live image processing through OpenCV. The model is trained on FER dataset which provides numerous facial images representing different emotions. Using Flask along with HTML and CSS, a GUI was created that allows real-time emotion prediction from webcam.
